# WXT Hot Reload Setup

## How Auto-Reload Works

WXT includes automatic extension reloading in development mode. When enabled, the extension will automatically reload in Chrome when you make changes to your code.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
cd packages/extension
npm run dev
```

This starts WXT in watch mode with hot-reload enabled.

### 2. Load the Extension in Chrome
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `packages/extension/dist-wxt/chrome-mv3` folder

### 3. Initial Setup (One Time Only)
After loading the extension for the first time with `npm run dev` running:
1. Click the reload button on the extension card once
2. The auto-reload client will be injected

### 4. Verify Auto-Reload is Working
1. Make a change to any source file (e.g., change text in popup)
2. Save the file
3. Watch the terminal - you'll see WXT rebuild
4. The extension should automatically reload in Chrome (no manual reload needed)

## Configuration

The hot-reload is configured in `wxt.config.ts`:
```typescript
dev: {
  reloadOnChange: true,  // Enable auto-reload
  server: {
    port: 3000,          // Dev server port
    hostname: 'localhost'
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Auto-Reloading?

1. **Check the console**: Open the extension's background page console
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click "background page" link on your extension
   - Look for "WXT Auto-reload client connected" message

2. **Restart the dev server**:
   - Stop `npm run dev` (Ctrl+C)
   - Start it again: `npm run dev`
   - Manually reload the extension once

3. **Clear extension cache**:
   - Remove the extension from Chrome
   - Delete `packages/extension/dist-wxt` folder
   - Run `npm run dev` again
   - Load the extension fresh

### Manual Reload Fallback

If auto-reload isn't working, you can always manually reload:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click the reload button (â†») on the Wingman extension card

## Notes

- Auto-reload only works in development mode (`npm run dev`)
- Production builds (`npm run build`) do not include auto-reload
- Some changes (like manifest changes) may require a manual reload
- Content scripts changes should auto-reload the extension and refresh affected tabs
