# P2P WebRTC Manual Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan walks you through manually testing the P2P WebRTC functionality across multiple machines. You'll test both successful P2P connections and fallback to relay mode.

## Architecture Recap

```
Developer Machine ‚Üí Relay Server ‚Üí Tunnel Server ‚Üê PM Browser
                     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
                    P2P Host ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí P2P Client
                   (Node.js)          (Browser JS)
```

- **Relay Mode**: All traffic goes through tunnel server
- **P2P Mode**: Direct connection between developer and PM browser
- **Automatic Fallback**: If P2P fails, falls back to relay

## Prerequisites

### Machine Setup
- **Machine 1 (Developer)**: Your development machine with the app running
- **Machine 2 (PM)**: Another computer/laptop/tablet with a modern browser
- **Both machines**: Should be on the same network for best P2P success

### Software Requirements
1. Node.js 18+ on developer machine
2. Chrome/Firefox/Safari on PM machine
3. The tunnel server deployed (or running locally for testing)

## Test Setup

### Step 1: Start Tunnel Server (if testing locally)
```bash
# On developer machine or separate server
cd packages/tunnel-server
npm run dev

# Note the URL (e.g., http://localhost:9876)
```

### Step 2: Start Your Local App
```bash
# On developer machine - start whatever app you want to tunnel
# For example, a simple React app:
npx create-react-app test-app
cd test-app
npm start
# Running on http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Start Relay Server with P2P
```bash
# On developer machine
cd packages/relay-server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, create a tunnel session:
npx wingman tunnel --port 3000

# You'll see output like:
# üöÄ Creating tunnel session...
# ‚úÖ Tunnel established!
# 
# Session URL: http://ghost-whiskey.localhost:9876
# or for production: https://ghost-whiskey.wingmanux.com
# 
# Share this URL with your PM to access your local app
# P2P: Enabled (will attempt direct connection)
```

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Successful P2P Connection (Same Network)

**Setup**: Both machines on same WiFi/LAN

1. **Developer Machine**:
   - Start tunnel as above
   - Watch console for: `[P2PHost] P2P connection established`

2. **PM Machine**:
   - Open the session URL in browser
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for these messages:
     ```
     [P2P] Initializing P2P client as initiator
     [P2P] Peer connection established
     [ConnectionMonitor] P2P connection established
     ```

3. **Verify P2P is Working**:
   - In PM browser, look for "P2P" badge (green)
   - Check connection stats on the page
   - Navigate through the app - should be very responsive
   - In DevTools Network tab, requests should NOT go to tunnel server

4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Connection established in 2-5 seconds
   - Very low latency (<50ms typical on LAN)
   - All app features work normally
   - No data going through tunnel server

### Test 2: P2P Fallback (Different Networks)

**Setup**: Machines on different networks (e.g., one on WiFi, one on mobile hotspot)

1. **Developer Machine**:
   - Start tunnel as before
   - Watch for: `[P2PHost] Failed to initialize P2P`

2. **PM Machine**:
   - Open session URL
   - Watch console for:
     ```
     [P2P] Initializing P2P client...
     [ConnectionMonitor] P2P connection timeout, staying on relay
     [ConnectionMonitor] Using relay mode
     ```

3. **Verify Relay Mode**:
   - Look for "RELAY" badge (yellow/orange)
   - App still works but slightly higher latency
   - In Network tab, requests go through tunnel server

### Test 3: P2P Connection Loss & Recovery

**Setup**: Start on same network, then simulate network issues

1. **Establish P2P** (Test 1)

2. **Simulate Network Issue**:
   - Option A: Disconnect developer machine from WiFi briefly
   - Option B: Use browser DevTools to throttle network
   - Option C: Block WebRTC in browser settings

3. **Watch Fallback**:
   ```
   [ConnectionMonitor] P2P unhealthy, falling back to relay
   [IframeProxy] Using relay fallback
   ```

4. **Restore Network**:
   - Reconnect WiFi or remove throttling
   - System should attempt P2P again after cooldown

### Test 4: Connection Monitoring

1. **Open Connection Stats**:
   - Look for stats display on session page
   - Should show:
     - Mode: P2P or RELAY
     - Latency: XXms
     - Data sent/received
     - P2P success rate

2. **Monitor During Use**:
   - Stats update every 30 seconds
   - Watch latency changes
   - See data transfer amounts

### Test 5: Multiple PM Connections

**Setup**: Open session URL on multiple devices

1. **First PM**: Connect normally
2. **Second PM**: Open same URL on different device
3. **Expected**: Both should work, may share P2P connection

### Test 6: Browser Compatibility

Test on different browsers:

1. **Chrome**: Full P2P support expected
2. **Firefox**: P2P should work
3. **Safari**: May have limited P2P, falls back to relay
4. **Mobile browsers**: Often fallback to relay

## Debugging Guide

### Check P2P Status

**Developer Console**:
```bash
# Check if P2P host initialized
grep "P2PHost" in relay server logs

# Common messages:
"[P2PHost] Initializing P2P host"
"[P2PHost] P2P connection established"
"[P2PHost] Peer connection error"
```

**PM Browser Console**:
```javascript
// Check P2P client status
window.p2pClient?.isP2PConnected()

// Get connection stats
window.connectionMonitor?.getReport()

// Force fallback (for testing)
window.p2pClient?.cleanup()
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| P2P never connects | Always shows RELAY | Check firewall, ensure same network |
| High latency on P2P | >200ms on LAN | Check network congestion |
| Frequent fallbacks | Switches between P2P/RELAY | Network instability, check WiFi |
| No iframe loads | Blank page | Check tunnel server is running |
| CORS errors | Console errors | Ensure proper URL structure |

### Network Requirements for P2P

**Best case** (P2P works):
- Same local network
- No restrictive firewalls
- UDP not blocked
- STUN accessible

**Fallback case** (Relay only):
- Corporate networks
- Different networks
- Strict firewalls
- Mobile networks

## Performance Expectations

### P2P Mode
- **LAN**: 5-20ms latency
- **Same city**: 20-50ms latency
- **Data transfer**: Direct, no server bandwidth used
- **Connection time**: 2-5 seconds

### Relay Mode
- **Latency**: +50-200ms (depends on server location)
- **Data transfer**: Through tunnel server
- **Connection time**: <1 second
- **Reliability**: 100% (always works)

## Test Checklist

- [ ] P2P connects on same network
- [ ] Relay fallback works on different networks
- [ ] Connection monitor shows correct status
- [ ] Stats display updates properly
- [ ] Iframe loads and app functions
- [ ] Navigation works in iframe
- [ ] Form submissions work

## Advanced Testing

### Test with Network Conditions

Use Chrome DevTools Network throttling:
1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Click throttling dropdown
3. Test with:
   - Fast 3G
   - Slow 3G
   - Offline (should show connection lost)

### Test with VPN

1. Developer on VPN, PM not (or vice versa)
2. Both on same VPN
3. Both on different VPNs

Expected: P2P fails, relay works

### Test Persistence

1. Establish P2P connection
2. Leave running for 30+ minutes
3. Verify connection stays stable
4. Check for memory leaks in DevTools

## Logging for Bug Reports

If you encounter issues, gather:

1. **Developer logs**:
```bash
# Copy relay server console output
# Include any error messages
```

2. **PM browser logs**:
```javascript
// In browser console:
console.save = function(data, filename){
  // ... (browser console export)
}
// Export and attach to bug report
```

3. **Network info**:
- Both machines' network type
- Firewall settings
- VPN status
- Browser versions

## Success Criteria

The P2P implementation is successful if:

1. ‚úÖ P2P connects reliably on same network (>80% success)
2. ‚úÖ Fallback to relay always works (100% reliability)
3. ‚úÖ Latency improvement measurable with P2P
4. ‚úÖ No data loss during mode switches
5. ‚úÖ User experience remains smooth
6. ‚úÖ Connection status clearly visible
7. ‚úÖ Works across major browsers

## Next Steps

After testing:
1. Document any issues found
2. Note which network configurations work/don't work
3. Measure typical latencies in your environment
4. Provide feedback on user experience
5. Suggest improvements for connection reliability

## Quick Test Commands Reference

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start tunnel server (if local)
cd packages/tunnel-server && npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start your app
cd my-app && npm start

# Terminal 3: Start relay with P2P
cd packages/relay-server && npm run dev

# Terminal 4: Create tunnel
npx wingman tunnel --port 3000

# Share the URL with PM machine!
```

Remember: The goal is seamless experience whether P2P works or not. Users shouldn't need to think about the connection mode - it should "just work"!
